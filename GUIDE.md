--------------------------------------------
To integrate your existing code with the Django models and views, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Create Django Models:**
   - Define Django models in your app's `models.py` file to represent users, accounts, and transactions. You can use the models provided earlier as a guide.
   - Replace the existing `customers` list with database operations using Django models.

2. **Create Django Views:**
   - Define views in your app's `views.py` file to handle user interactions and business logic.
   - Rewrite your existing functions (`create_acc`, `acc_balance`, `withdrawals`, `transfer`, `deposit`, `main`) as Django views.

3. **Configure URLs:**
   - Map URL patterns to your views in your app's `urls.py` file.

4. **Create Templates:**
   - Create HTML templates for your app's pages (e.g., homepage, account creation, balance inquiry, transactions, etc.) in your app's `templates` directory.

Here's a high-level guide on how to proceed:

1. **Define Django Models:**
   - Open your `models.py` file and define models for users, accounts, and transactions using Django's `models.Model` class.
   - Replace the existing `customers` list with a `CustomUser` model and related models for accounts and transactions.

2. **Create Django Views:**
   - Open your `views.py` file and define views for account creation, balance inquiry, withdrawals, transfers, and deposits.
   - Rewrite your existing functions as Django views, incorporating Django's database operations and authentication.

3. **Configure URLs:**
   - Open your app's `urls.py` file and define URL patterns to map to your views.
   - Add URL patterns for each view (e.g., `/create-account/`, `/balance/`, `/withdrawals/`, `/transfer/`, `/deposit/`).

4. **Create Templates:**
   - Create HTML templates for your app's pages in the `templates` directory of your app.
   - Use Django's template language to render dynamic content and forms.

5. **Integrate Django Forms (Optional):**
   - Consider using Django forms to handle form validation and data processing in your views.
   - Define Django forms in your app's `forms.py` file and use them in your views.
 
6. **Test Your Application:**
   - Test your Django application locally to ensure that all features and functionalities work as expected.
   - Debug any issues and refine your code as needed.

By following these steps, you can integrate your existing code with Django models and views to create a full-fledged banking application. Remember to utilize Django's built-in features for authentication, database operations, and form handling to streamline development and ensure security.
